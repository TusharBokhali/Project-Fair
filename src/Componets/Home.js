                Pure honey is a natural product that's dense, has a soft
                texture, and a sweet aroma. It's made from honey that's been
                filtered to remove dirt, pollen, and dead bees, and it doesn't
                contain added sweeteners, oils, or flavors.

              <h1>About Honey</h1>
              <div>
                <p>
                  Over its history as a food, the main uses of honey are in
                  cooking, baking, desserts, as a spread on bread, as an
                  addition to various beverages such as tea, and as a sweetener
                  in some commercial beverages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to its energy density, honey is an important food for
                  virtually all hunter-gatherer cultures in warm climates, with
                  the Hadza people ranking honey as their favorite food.
